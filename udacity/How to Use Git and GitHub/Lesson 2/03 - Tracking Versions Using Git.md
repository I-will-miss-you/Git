## check all the statements that would be true if you tracked changes using Git:

- You would be able yo see the difference between the two versions, but you would no longer be able to directly access the old version.
- --» Using ``` git diff ``` to compare the two versions would show the same changes as ``` diff -u ``` did in the previous exercise.
- The name of the file would change when you saved a second version in Git
- --» To save two versions of the file, you would create two commits.
